# Packaging status

## RHVoice in Snap Store

An alpha version of the RHVoice snap is now available in the Snap Store. Please help us test it and fix bugs.

The snap only installs the RHVoice TTS engine itself, including the module connecting Speech Dispatcher to RHVoice. Voices need to be installed via the newly implemented command-line voice manager.

Install the snap:

```bash
sudo snap install --edge rhvoice
```

The voice manager must be run as root.

List available voices:

```bash
sudo rhvoice.vm -a
```

Install a voice, for example, Alan:

```bash
sudo rhvoice.vm -i alan
```

List installed voices:

```bash
sudo rhvoice.vm -l
```

Test if it speaks:

```bash
echo hello|rhvoice.test
```

Unfortunately, we are not aware of any way we could register RHVoice with Speech Dispatcher automatically. You will have to manually either add a symlink to the module or define the module in Speech Dispatcher's configuration file. We aren't sure if the absolute path to the module will remain the same on all the systems supporting snap packages. On Ubuntu the path is /snap/rhvoice/current/bin/sd_rhvoice.
