Run 'RHVoice --help' to see the supported command line options.
If you want to configure Voiceman tu use RHVoice for Russian output,
you should add a new output section in voiceman.conf. Here's an
example:

[output]
name = RHVoice
type = command
lang = rus
synth command = "RHVoice -r %r -p %p -v %v"
alsa player command = "play -"
pitch num digits after dot = 2
pitch min = 0
pitch aver = 50
pitch max = 100
rate num digits after dot = 2
rate min = 0
rate aver = 20
rate max = 100
volume num digits after dot = 2
volume min = 0
volume aver = 50
volume max = 100
