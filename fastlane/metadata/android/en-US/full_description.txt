RHVoice is a free and open source speech synthesizer.
Voices are built from recordings of natural speech. They have small footprints, because it's only statistical models.
Although the voices lack the naturalness, which is typical for synthesizers which generates speech by combining segments of the recordings themselves. But they are still very intelligible and resemble the speakers whose voices were recorded.

<b>Supported languages:</b>
Initially, RHVoice could speak only Russian. Now it also supports American English, Brazilian Portuguese, Esperanto, Georgian, Ukrainian, Kyrgyz and Tatar.
