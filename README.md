# RHVoice

RHVoice is a free and open-source speech synthesizer.

## Features

### Speech synthesis method

RHVoice uses [statistical parametric synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis#HMM-based_synthesis).
It relies on existing open-source speech technologies (mainly
[HTS](http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp) and related software).

Voices are built from recordings of natural speech. They have small footprints,
because only statistical models are stored on users' computers. And though the
voices lack the naturalness of the synthesizers which generate speech by
combining segments of the recordings themselves, they are still very
intelligible and resemble the speakers who recorded the source material.

### Supported languages

Initially, RHVoice could speak only Russian. Now it also supports:

* American English
* Brazilian Portuguese
* Esperanto
* Georgian
* Ukrainian
* Kyrgyz
* Tatar
* Macedonian
* Albanian

In theory, it is possible to implement support for
other languages, if all the necessary resources can be found or
created.

### Synthesis example
